## Adding Images

<'img>
To add an image into the page you need to use an <'img> element. This is an empty
element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the
following two attributes:

+ src
This tells the browser where
it can find the image file. This
will usually be a relative URL
pointing to an image on your
own site. (Here you can see that
the images are in a child folder
called images .

+ alt
This provides a text description
of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it.

+ title
You can also use the title
attribute with the <'img> element
to provide additional information
about the image. Most browsers
will display the content of this
attribute in a tootip when the
user hovers over the image.

## for styling the img use

+ height
This specifies the height of the
image in pixels.
+ width
This specifies the width of the
image in pixels.

# Color

You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:rgb valuesThese express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90) hex CodesThese are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign.
