# Images

You can control the size of an
image using the width and
height properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box.

Specifying image sizes helps
pages to load more smoothly
because the HTML and CSS
code will often load before the images, and telling the browser how much space to leave for an
image allows it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to download.

### ALIGNING IMAGES USING CSS

1: The float property is added
to the class that was created to
represent the size of the image

2: New classes are created with
names such as align-left or
align-right to align the images
to the left or right of the page.
These class names are used in
addition to classes that indicate
the size of the image.

### Center the img

By default, images are inline
elements. This means that they
flow within the surrounding text.
In order to center an image, it
should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display
property with a value of block.
Once it has been made into a
block-level element, there are
two common ways in which you
can horizontally center an image:

1: On the containing element,
you can use the text-align
property with a value of center.

2: On the image itself, you can
use the use the margin property
and set the values of the left and
right margins to auto.

### background-image

The background-image
property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML
element. This could be the entire
page or just part of the page. By
default, a background image will
repeat to fill the entire box.

The path to the image follows
the letters url, and it is put
inside parentheses and quotes.

## Practical Information

Search Engine
Optimization (SEO)> s the practice of trying
to help your site appear nearer
the top of search engine results
when people look for the topics
that your website covers.

In every page of your website there are seven key places

1. Page Title
The page title appears at the top
of the browser window or on the
tab of a browser. It is specified in
the <'title> element which lives
inside the <;head> element.

2. URL / Web Address
The name of the file is part of
the URL. Where possible, use
keywords in the file name.

3. Headings  If the keywords are in a heading <hn;> element then a search
engine will know that this page is
all about that subject and give it
greater weight than other text.

4. Text
Where possible, it helps to
repeat the keywords in the main
body of the text at least 2-3
times. Do not, however, over-use
these terms, because the text
must be easy for a human to
read.

5. Link Text
Use keywords in the text that
create links between pages
(rather than using generic
expressions such as "click here").

6. Image Alt Text
Search engines rely on you
providing accurate descriptions
of images in the alt text. This
will also help your images show
up in the results of image-based
searches.

7. Page Descriptions
The description also lives inside
the <;head> element and is
specified using a <;meta> tag.
It should be a sentence that
describes the content of the
page.
