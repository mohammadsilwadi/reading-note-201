# **Links**

Links are created using the <'a> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening <'a> tag and the closing </a'> tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

# **Layout**
HTML Layout Techniques

There are four different techniques to create multicolumn layouts. Each technique has its pros and cons:

    CSS framework
    CSS float property
    CSS flexbox
    CSS grid

CSS Frameworks

If you want to create your layout fast, you can use a CSS framework, like W3.CSS or Bootstrap.
CSS Float Layout

It is common to do entire web layouts using the CSS float property. Float is easy to learn - you just need to remember how the float and clear properties work. Disadvantages: Floating elements are tied to the document flow, which may harm the flexibility. Learn more about float in our CSS Float and Clear chapter.
HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:
HTML5 Semantic Elements.	

    <'header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
    <'nav> - Defines a set of navigation links
    <'section> - Defines a section in a document
    <article> - Defines an independent, self-contained content
    <'aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
    <'footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
    <'details> - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
    <'summary> - Defines a heading for the <details> element

# **Functions, Methods, and Objects**.
## **Java Methods**
A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.

Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.

Why use methods? To reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times.
**JavaScript Functions**>*A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.*

*A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).*
**JavaScript Function Syntax**>>

*A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().*

*Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).*

*The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)*

*The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}*

Function nameOfTheFunction(parameter1){
statement
}

nameOfTheFunction(value)>>>>>here we call the function by his name.
